* The email address of the user to be added.

## Method
1. Log in to the [Client Portal](https://core.thermo.io/login/).
2. From the <**Your_Name**> list on the upper right, click **Team**.

   * This person will receive an email with a link to a form requiring his or her email address, name, and password to gain access to this account.
   * Alternatively, if the user is already active on a separate Client Portal account, they should use the option to use an existing login rather than enter the above information.

You may edit or delete team members by following the instructions in [Editing team members in the Client Portal](https://www.thermo.io/how-to/client-portal/editing-team-members) for more information.

It is also possible to [create your own teams](https://www.thermo.io/how-to/client-portal/creating-teams) and [edit them as desired](https://www.thermo.io/how-to/client-portal/editing-teams).
