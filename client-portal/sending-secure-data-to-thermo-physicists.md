# Sending Secure Data to Thermo Physicists through the Client Portal

## Overview
If you require support and want to grant temporary server access to a Thermo Physicist, the Client Portal makes it safe and easy. 

## But first...
You will need your [Client Portal](https://core.thermo.io/login/) username and password. If you cannot locate this information, click **Forget Password?** on the Client Portal login page, or [contact a Thermo Physicist](mailto:physicists@thermo.io).

## Method
1. From the dashboard, click the **+ icon**, then **Contact Support**.
