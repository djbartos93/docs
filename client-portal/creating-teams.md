# Creating Teams in the Client Portal

## What you need
* Your [Client Portal](https://core.thermo.io/login/) username and password. If you cannot locate this information, click **Forget Password?** on the Client Portal login page.
* Existing team members; see [Adding Team Members in the Client Portal](https://www.thermo.io/how-to/client-portal/adding-team-members) for more information.

## Method
Your Client Portal uses three default roles: Superuser, Billing, and Technical. If you prefer, you can create your own teams and associated permissions by using the method below. 

1. Log in to the [Client Portal](https://core.thermo.io/login/).
2. From the <**Your_Name**> list on the upper right, click **Team**.

5. Designate which areas this team has access to by choosing the **View**, **Edit**, or **Delete** check box. If you leave a section blank,Â then the team has no access to that area. Click **SUBMIT** when done.
