# Contributing to Thermo

Welcome to the Thermo Repo! Here, you will find everything you need to start contributing to the Thermo Library. All you need is a GitHub account and the ability to explain how to solve a problem.

## Crucial criteria
* **Accuracy:** Your procedures are straightforward, correct, and tested. For each action, include the “why” as well as the “what.” Explain the purpose behind each action.
* **Completeness:** Your guide produces a complete, functional configuration. When appropriate, your guide also gives readers of what to do next and provides all critical elements of security and other best practices.
* **Originality:** Anything that is not raw code is original content written exclusively for Thermo.

## Payments
We dispense all payments via PayPal. In most cases, we process payment within 30 days of publication, though in some cases in may take longer.
  Updates under 500 words (for example, CentOS 6 > 7) $100
  Simple guides, 500 - 999 words                      $200
  Complex guides, 1000+ words                         $300

## Submission process
Much of this process will be familiar to anyone familiar with GitHub. This section outlines the entire process, from your pull request (PR) to publication.

1. Submit your PR to the [thermo.io/docs master branch](https://github.com/thermoio/docs).
2. One or more subject matter experts (SMEs) reviews your PR and evaluates it for accuracy and completeness. They may direct your to make changes to your PR that must be resolved before proceeding to Step 3, or they may reject it.
3. The editor reviews your PR for adherence to our conventions and Style Guide, as well as checks it for accuracy, completeness, and originality. The editor may direct you to make further changes that must be resolved before proceeding to Step 4.
4. Our team conducts a final review. Upon acceptance, the editor sends you the IP Agreement in DocuSign.
5. Upon completion of the IP Agreement, our team merges your PR and publishes your submission to the Thermo Library.
